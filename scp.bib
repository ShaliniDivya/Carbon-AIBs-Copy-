In this work, we demonstrate that synthetic kish graphite, which is a byproduct of steelmaking, can be used as a cathode in AlCl3-GB and exhibits high capacities of {$\leq$}142 mAh g(-1). The comprehensive characterization of kish graphite flakes and other forms of graphite by X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area analysis provides solid evidence that the exceptional electrochemical behavior of kish graphite flakes is mainly determined by the high structural order of carbon atoms, a low level of defects, and a unique "crater morphology". In view of the nonrocking chair operation mechanism of AlCl3-GB, we have tested the achievable energy densities as a function of the composition of chloroaluminate ionic liquid (AlCl3 content) and have obtained energy densities of up to 65 Wh kg(-1). In addition, the kish graphite flakes can rapidly charge and discharge, offering high power densities of up to 4363 W kg(-1).},

Among them, Al-ion batteries based on aluminum anode and graphite carbon cathode have gained lots of interests as one of the most promising technologies. Here, it is demonstrated that the size of graphitic material in ab plane and c direction plays an important role in anion intercalation chemistry. Sharply decreasing the size of vertical dimension (c direction) strongly facilitates the kinetics and charge transfer of anions (de)intercalation. On the other hand, increasing the size of horizontal dimension (ab plane) contributes to improving the flexibility of graphitic materials, which results in raising the cycling stability. Meanwhile, chloroaluminate anions are reversibly intercalated into the interlayer of graphite materials, leading to the staging behaviors. In the end, an ultrafast Al-ion battery with exceptional long life is achieved based on large-sized few-layer graphene as a cathode and aluminum metal as an anode.},

  abstract = {High surface area porous carbon frameworks exhibit potential advantages over crystalline graphite as an electrochemical energy storage material owing to the possibility of faster ion transport and up to double the ion capacity, assuming a surface-based mechanism of storage. When detrimental surface-related effects such as irreversible capacity loss due to interphase formation (known as solid-electrolyte interphase, SEI) can be mitigated or altogether avoided, the greatest advantage can be achieved by maximizing the gravimetric and volumetric surface area and by tailoring the porosity to accommodate the relevant ion species. We investigate this concept by employing zeolite-templated carbon (ZTC) as the cathode in an aluminum battery based on a chloroaluminate ionic liquid electrolyte. Its ultrahigh surface area and dense, conductive network of homogeneous channels (12 {\AA} in width) render ZTC suitable for the fast, dense storage of AlCl4\textendash{} ions (6 {\AA} in ionic diameter). With aluminum as the anode, full cells were prepared which simultaneously exhibited both high specific energy (up to 64 Wh kg\textendash{}1, 30 Wh L\textendash{}1) and specific power (up to 290 W kg\textendash{}1, 93 W L\textendash{}1), highly stable cycling performance, and complete reversibility within the potential range of 0.01\textendash{}2.20 V.},

Much research has focused on the judicious selection of graphite cathode materials, leading to the most notable recent advances in the performance of AlCl3-GBs. However, the major obstacle to commercializing this technology is the lack of oxidatively stable, inexpensive current collectors that can operate in chloroaluminate ionic liquids and are composed of earth-abundant elements. This study presents the use of titanium nitride (TiN) as a compelling material for this purpose. Flexible current collectors can be fabricated by coating TiN on stainless steel or flexible polyimide substrates by low-cost, rapid, scalable methods such as magnetron sputtering. When these current collectors are used in AlCl3-GB coin or pouch cells, stable cathodic operation is observed at voltages of up to 2.5 V versus Al3+/Al.

We exclude the possibility of Al3+ cation intercalation into graphite as in standard Li-ion batteries. Instead, we show that the AlCl4- anion intercalation mechanism is thermodynamically feasible. By including the ionic liquid electrolyte in the overall redox reaction, we are able to reproduce the high voltage observed in experiment. The active involvement of electrolyte in the reaction suggests that the evaluation of energy density needs to take the electrolyte into consideration. Our proposed structural model is consistent with the new peaks appearing in X-ray diffraction from the intercalation compound. The high rate capability is explained by the ultralow diffusion barriers of the AlCl4 intercalant. With the clarified working mechanism, it becomes clear that the high voltage of the Al-graphite cell is a result of the thermodynamic instability of the AlCl4-intercalated graphite. \textcopyright{} 2017 American Chemical Society.},

Because of this, onion-like carbon can be fabricated into electrodes, used as a conductive additive, and may have potential in composites and additive manufacturing. However due to agglomeration of OLC particles, creating a stable, aqueous dispersion for ink production or formulating composites proves challenging. We explore how attrition milling, acid treatment, and probe sonication can be employed to decrease agglomeration and provide colloidal stability in aqueous media. We also investigate how the electrochemical performance changes with each processing step as well as the treatments in succession. When tested in electrochemical capacitors, the processing increases the capacitance by a factor of three, due to an added pseudocapacitive contribution which is not present in untreated OLC. As a result, the processing of OLC proves to be advantageous for the production of stable, aqueous solutions, which also exhibit improved electrochemical properties suitable for functional inks, conductive additives, and fabrication of composite electrodes.},

  abstract = {The thermodynamic properties of magnesium make it a natural choice for use as an anode material in rechargeable batteries, because it may provide a considerably higher energy density than the commonly used lead\textendash{}acid and nickel\textendash{}cadmium systems. Moreover, in contrast to lead and cadmium, magnesium is inexpensive, environmentally friendly and safe to handle. But the development of Mg batteries has been hindered by two problems. First, owing to the chemical activity of Mg, only solutions that neither donate nor accept protons are suitable as electrolytes; but most of these solutions allow the growth of passivating surface films, which inhibit any electrochemical reaction. Second, the choice of cathode materials has been limited by the difficulty of intercalating Mg ions in many hosts. Following previous studies of the electrochemistry of Mg electrodes in various non-aqueous solutions, and of a variety of intercalation electrodes, we have now developed rechargeable Mg battery systems that show promise for applications. The systems comprise electrolyte solutions based on Mg organohaloaluminate salts, and MgxMo 3S4 cathodes, into which Mg ions can be intercalated reversibly, and with relatively fast kinetics. We expect that further improvements in the energy density will make these batteries a viable alternative to existing systems.},

  volume = {19},
  issn = {1463-9084},
  abstract = {Identifying a suitable electrode material with desirable electrochemical properties remains a primary challenge for rechargeable Al-ion batteries. Recently an ultrafast rechargeable Al-ion battery was reported with high charge/discharge rate, (relatively) high discharge voltage and high capacity that uses a graphite-based cathode. Using calculations from first-principles, we have investigated the staging mechanism of AlCl4 intercalation into bulk graphite and evaluated the stability, specific capacity and voltage profile of AlCl4 intercalated compounds. Ab initio molecular dynamics is performed to investigate the thermal stability of AlCl4 intercalated graphite structures. Our voltage profiles show that the first AlCl4 intercalation step could be a more sluggish step than the successive intercalation steps. However, the diffusion of AlCl4 is very fast in the expanded graphite host layers with a diffusion barrier of {$\sim$}0.01 eV, which justifies the ultrafast charging rate of a graphite based Al-ion battery. And such an AlCl4 intercalated battery provides an average voltage of 2.01\textendash{}2.3 V with a maximum specific capacity of 69.62 mA h g-1, which is excellent for anion intercalated batteries. Our density of states and Bader charge analysis shows that the AlCl4 intercalation into the bulk graphite is a charging process. Hence, we believe that our present study will be helpful in understanding the staging mechanism of AlCl4 intercalation into graphite-like layered electrodes for Al-ion batteries, thus encouraging further experimental work.},

In this work, we explore using density functional theory calculations the feasibility of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) as a cathode material for Al batteries. Carbon nanotubes with hollow structures and large surface area are able to overcome the difficulty of activating the opening of interlayer spaces as observed in graphite electrode during the first intercalation cycle. Our results show that AlCl4 binds strongly with the SWNT to result in an energetically and thermally stable AlCl4-adsorbed SWNT system. Diffusion calculations show that the SWNT system allows ultrafast diffusion of AlCl4 with a more favorable inner surface diffusion than outer surface diffusion. Our charge-density difference and Bader atomic charge analysis confirm the oxidation of SWNT upon adsorption of AlCl4, which shows a similar behavior to the previously studied graphite cathode. The average open-circuit voltage and AlCl4 storage capacity increases with increasing SWNT diameter and can be as high as 1.96\hspace{0.25em}V and 275\hspace{0.25em}mA\,h\,g-1 in (25,25) SWNT relative to graphite (70\hspace{0.25em}mA\,h\,g-1).

We also show that the presence of structural defects in few layer graphene such as pores induced via plasma exposure or nitrogen dopants can deteriorate the cell performance by either decreasing the electrical connectivity or precluding stage-one intercalation respectively.

The stage and atomic structure of the graphite intercalation compounds (GICs) are elucidated, in line with the experimental finding. It is revealed that the intercalants tend to be inserted at relative high densities with a charging potential profile and theoretical specific capacity that agree well with the experiment. Four stable GIC configurations are identified with essentially the same chemical potential for the intercalant, giving rise to charging potential plateaus. Low diffusion energy barriers of the intercalants are found, which underlie the ultrafast (dis)charging rates of the battery.},

  abstract = {Certain microporous carbons have pores of molecular dimensions, the size of which can be adjusted over a wide range to fit the dimensions of a large variety of molecules. With knowing the dimensions of these molecules, size-calibrated porous carbons can be produced. In this work, we took advantage of the electronic conductivity of carbon in using it as an electrode in electrolytic solutions. By changing the electrode potential, we could induce electroadsorption and electrodesorption of ions of different dimensions into pore-calibrated carbons, thus enabling us to estimate effective ion sizes. A few fundamental questions such as whether ions accommodated in the electrodes' pores are in a solvated state, which is important for novel electrochemical energy storage devices and for microbiological systems, could be addressed. Analysis of the results indicates that all the cations that are employed are electroadsorbed in the electrode pores in hydrated states. Compared with the monovalent cations, the bivalent cations exhibit dimensions that make them almost twice as big. Monovalent anions are basically adsorbed in a nonhydrated state. The doubly charged sulfate anion is adsorbed in the hydrated state. The nitrate, a multiatom planar anion, has a smaller effective dimension than the monoatomic halogen anions, in accordance with the observation that the pores in many activated carbons are slit-shaped. The analysis of the results enabled us to establish a scale of ionic effective dimensions in aqueous media, as presented below (MTBE stands for methyl tert-butyl ether):\, cations, [3.62 {\AA}, N2] {$<$} Cs+ {$<$} K+ {$<$} Na+ {$<$} Li+ {$<$} [4.21 {\AA}, CF4] {$<$} [5.05 {\AA}, SF6] {$<$} [5.8 {\AA}, MTBE] {$<$} Ba2+, Ca2+, and Mg2+; anions, [3.62 {\AA}, N2] {$<$} NO3- {$<$} Cl- {$<$} F- {$<$} Br- {$<$} [4.21 {\AA}, CF4] {$<$} ClO4- {$<$} [5.05 {\AA}, SF6] {$<$} [5.8 {\AA}, MTBE] {$<$} SO2-.

Acetone dispersions of C-NERGY\texttrademark{} Super C45 and LiCoO2 showed the lowest viscosities attributed to the carbon black's specific BET surface area of 45m2g-1 being the lowest of all carbon blacks studied. The easy dispersibility of C-NERGY\texttrademark{} Super C45 in LiCoO2 could be explained by its particular surface group chemistry characterized by time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry. The electrical volume resistivity of the LiCoO2/carbon black mixtures was in line with the high current rate performance of half-cells with related LiCoO2 electrodes. Compared to the investigated carbon blacks, the electrical volume resistivity of the graphite conductive additives C-NERGY\texttrademark{} KS6L and C-NERGY\texttrademark{} SFG6L at different concentrations in LiCoO2 powders showed higher critical volume fractions but lower ultimate resistivity levels.

Continuous or discontinuous manometric techniques can be employed for nitrogen adsorption measurements at 77 K.

In spite of its artificial nature, the Brunauer\textendash{}Emmett\textendash{}Teller (BET) method is still used for the determination of surface area. In principle, nitrogen isotherms of Types II and IV are amenable to BET analysis provided that pores of molecular dimensions are absent and that the BET plot is obtained over an appropriate range of the isotherm. An empirical method based on the application of standard adsorption data is useful for checking the validity of the BET-area. All the computational procedures for pore size analysis have limitations of one sort or another. The various assumptions include an ideal pore shape, rigidity of the structure and an oversimplified model (capillary condensation or micropore filling). The derived pore widths and pore volumes should be regarded as effective (or apparent) values with respect to the adsorption of nitrogen at 77 K.},

The first two contributions have been intensively described and studied by many authors. The first part of this paper is focused on the use of surface treatments as a way to decrease the active material/current collector impedance. Al current collector foils have been treated following a two-step procedure: electrochemical etching and sol-gel coating by a highly-covering, conducting carbonaceous material. It aims to increase the Al foil/active material surface contact leading to lower resistance. In a second part, carbon-carbon supercapacitor impedance is discussed in term of complex capacitance and complex power from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy data. This representation permits extraction of a relaxation time constant that provides important information on supercapacitor behaviour. The influence of carbon nanotubes addition on electrochemical performance of carbon/carbon supercapacitors has also been studied by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.},

  abstract = {Smart adjustment of active mass loading on positive and negative electrodes, significant enhancement of energy density with long-term durability is achieved due to expand of operating potential window of the electrochemical capacitor. In the present contribution, two different carbon materials like indigenous activated carbon fibres and commercial Kuraray YP-50 carbon are utilised as electrodes and the equal/unequal mass configurations of electrochemical capacitor are systematically investigated by using 1 M tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate/AN as an organic electrolyte. The electrochemical performances of equal/unequal mass configurations are examined in terms of potential stability window and the durability of the electrochemical capacitor. The unequal mass configuration of carbon fibres electrodes shows 25\% higher gravimetric energy density than unequal commercial YP-50 electrodes. Besides, unequal mass configuration of carbon fibres exhibit 41\% higher gravimetric energy density as compared with commercial YP-50 carbon at 2.7 V as extensively reported in the literature. This result clearly explores the benefits of unequal mass configurations of electrochemical capacitor for extending the operation voltage window of organic electrolyte with long durability and this strategy enlightens the design of well-defined carbon-carbon based electrodes for commercial implementation.},

Storing and efficiently using electricity generated by intermittent sources and the transition of our transportation fleet to electric drive depend fundamentally on the development of EES systems with high energy and power densities. Supercapacitors are promising devices for highly efficient energy storage and power management, yet they still suffer from moderate energy densities compared to batteries. To establish a detailed understanding of the science and technology of carbon/carbon supercapacitors, this review discusses the basic principles of the electrical double-layer (EDL), especially regarding the correlation between ion size/ion solvation and the pore size of porous carbon electrodes. We summarize the key aspects of various carbon materials synthesized for use in supercapacitors. With the objective of improving the energy density, the last two sections are dedicated to strategies to increase the capacitance by either introducing pseudocapacitive materials or by using novel electrolytes that allow to increasing the cell voltage. In particular, advances in ionic liquids, but also in the field of organic electrolytes, are discussed and electrode mass balancing is expanded because of its importance to create higher performance asymmetric electrochemical capacitors.},

The electrolytes are classified into several categories, including: aqueous, organic, ionic liquids, solid-state or quasi-solid-state, as well as redox-active electrolytes. Effects of electrolyte properties on ES performance are discussed in detail. The principles and methods of designing and optimizing electrolytes for ES performance and application are highlighted through a comprehensive analysis of the literature. Interaction among the electrolytes, electro-active materials and inactive components (current collectors, binders, and separators) is discussed. The challenges in producing high-performing electrolytes are analyzed. Several possible research directions to overcome these challenges are proposed for future efforts, with the main aim of improving ESs' energy density without sacrificing existing advantages (e.g., a high power density and a long cycle-life) (507 references).},

Studying the effect of the pore size on capacitance could potentially improve performance by maximizing the electrode surface area accessible to electrolyte ions, but until recently, no studies had addressed the lower size limit of accessible pores. Using carbide-derived carbon, we generated pores with average sizes from 0.6 to 2.25 nanometer and studied double-layer capacitance in an organic electrolyte. The results challenge the long-held axiom that pores smaller than the size of solvated electrolyte ions are incapable of contributing to charge storage.
Pores comparable in size to solvated anions and cations unexpectedly improve the capacitance in a carbon-based supercapacitor.

Li2SO4 (pH = 6.5) allows 99\% efficiency to be exhibited at 1.6 V cell potential with low self-discharge, while in BeSO4 (pH = 2.1) efficiency is low (81\%). Li2SO4 performs better due to high di-hydrogen over-potential at the negative electrode and related pH increase in AC porosity. When stainless steel current collectors are used in Li2SO4, the cell resistance suddenly increases after 12 hours floating at 1.6 V, due to corrosion of the positive collector. With nickel negative and stainless steel positive collectors, the electrode potentials are shifted by -105 mV at cell potential of 1.6 V, allowing stable cell parameters (capacitance, resistance) and reduction of corrosion products formation on positive steel collector after 120 hours floating. Phenanthrenequinone was grafted on activated carbon to get an additional faradaic contribution in buffer solutions (pH = 4.0 or 7.2). The three-electrode cell CVs show that the redox peaks of the phenanthrenequinone graft shift toward negative values when pH increases from 4 to 7.2. The grafted carbon displays a capacitance value of 194 F g-1 at pH = 4.0 as compared to 82 F g-1 for the as-received carbon.},

Trials are undertaken for estimating the role of micro and mesopores during charging the electrical double layer in both kinds of electrolytic solutions for which the electrical conductivity and the size of solvated ions are different. The effect of pseudocapacitance for maximising the total capacitance is especially documented. Carbons chemically modified by a strong oxidation treatment represent a very well defined region of pseudocapacitance properties due to the Faradaic redox reactions of their rich surface functionality. Conducting polymers (polyaniline, polypyrrole, polythiophene derivatives) and oxidised metallic particles (Ru, Mn, Co,\ldots{}) deposited on the carbons also participate in the enhancement of the final capacity through fast faradaic pseudocapacitance effects. Evaluation of capacitor performance by different techniques, e.g. voltammetry, impedance spectroscopy, charge/discharge characteristics is also discussed.},

  abstract = {Ruthenium dioxide is an important electrode material for applications in electrocatalysis and power sources. High surface areas are achieved in hydrous RuO2 precipitates and in mixed ruthenium oxide-titanium oxide, (Ru-Ti)Ox, aerogels (in which nanoscale domains are networked to form a highly porous structure). The electrochemical properties of (Ru-Ti)Ox aerogels, RuO2, and hydrous RuO2 are examined by direct pressing of sub-milligram quantities of the solid onto the surface of a conductive carbon/wax composite. Voltammetric measurements in acidic electrolyte confirm a pseudocapacitive response for all the RuOx-based materials. Despite an improvement in BET surface area, as compared with other RuO2 materials, the (Ru-Ti)Ox aerogel displays a low specific capacitance, which correlates to the high degree of crystallinity of the aerogel. Nanocrystallites of rutile RuO2, formed during thermal treatment of the sol-gel Ru/Ti precursors, deleteriously affect the specific capacitance of the material; however, all RuOx domains in the aerogel are voltammetrically addressable. The influence of proton-donating species on the observed capacitance for the (Ru-Ti)Ox aerogel is evident from the dependence of the voltammetric charge in acidic electrolyte on the potential scan rate.},

  abstract = {In the charged condition, electrochemical capacitors, like batteries, are in a state of high energy relative to that of the system in the discharged state. Hence there is a `driving force', corresponding to the free energy of discharge, tending to spontaneously diminish the charge if some mechanism(s) of self-discharge exist. An ideally polarizable (chargeable) capacitor has no self-discharge or current-leakage pathway and hence can remain charged indefinitely. However, practical capacitors, like batteries, suffer appreciable self-discharge over periods of days or months so that this phenomenon is of major interest in evaluation of capacitor performance and choice of materials to minimize self-discharge. Several mechanisms of self-discharge are distinguished and the resulting forms of the change of potential on open-circuit with time or log time provide a means of identifying the type of self-discharge process that occurs. With RuO2, some remarkable potential-recovery effects arise following discharge.},

A description is provided here of the common methods of self-discharge study: half cell vs. full cell measurements and open-circuit potential decay versus float currents. A description of some of the models used to evaluate faradaic self-discharge is presented, with a synopsis of the important aspects of the many available charge redistribution models. An overview of the current self-discharge mechanisms for various ECs is provided, highlighting that for many systems there are significant factors of the self-discharge process which remain unknown.

  abstract = {The charge storage mechanism in MnO2 electrode, used in aqueous electrolyte, was investigated by cyclic voltammetry and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Thin MnO2 films deposited on a platinum substrate and thick MnO2 composite electrodes were used. First, the cyclic voltammetry data established that only a thin layer of MnO2 is involved in the redox process and electrochemically active. Second, the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy data revealed that the manganese oxidation state was varying from III to IV for the reduced and oxidized forms of thin film electrodes, respectively, during the charge/discharge process. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy data also show that Na+ cations from the electrolyte were involved in the charge storage process of MnO2 thin film electrodes. However, the Na/Mn ratio for the reduced electrode was much lower than what was anticipated for charge compensation dominated by Na+, thus suggesting the involvement of protons in the pseudofaradaic mechanism. An important finding of this work is that, unlike thin film electrodes, no change of the manganese oxidation state was detected for a thicker composite electrode because only a very thin layer is involved in the charge storage process.},

  abstract = {In this paper an adaptive energy management strategy (EMS) based on fuzzy logic and the optimal sizing for a tramway with a hybrid energy storage system (ESS) combining batteries (BT) and supercapacitors (SC) are presented. The EMS applies a sliding window to estimate the forward energy consumption and adapt the instantaneous power target for BT and SC. The hybrid ESS sizing is obtained by an optimization with multi-objective genetic algorithms (GA). The fitness functions are expressed in economic terms, and correspond to the costs of the energy absorbed from the catenary as well as the operation cost of the hybrid ESS (investment and cycling cost). The selected case study is the tramway of Seville, which operates in zones with and without catenary. The aim is to minimize the daily operating cost of the tramway taking into account the BT and SC degradation approach (cycling) and fulfilling the performance of the tramway in the catenary-less zone. The proposed approach (adaptive EMS and optimal sizing) is compared with the current solution in the tramway (SC-based) and with a hybrid ESS managed by a rule-based EMS (RB-EMS) in terms of daily operating cost and energy harnessing during regenerative braking phase. The proposed approach show cost reductions up to 25.5\% (from SC-based), 6.2\% (from hybrid ESS with RB-EMS) and a global efficiency around 84.4\%.},

  issn = {1463-9084},
  abstract = {Spontaneous voltage drop between EDLC electrodes, when it is kept under the open-circuit condition, is commonly called `self-discharge' and is interpreted as a result of energy loss by the device. Three mechanisms of self-discharge were proposed: due to a leakage-current, faradaic reactions and charge redistribution. According to the law of energy preservation, if the voltage drop is associated with the energy loss, the energy would more likely be exchanged with the environment. While heat generation was measured during EDLC charging and discharging, the corresponding effect during storage under open-circuit conditions has not been reported. This may support the conclusion that voltage changes during `self-discharge' are not related to a considerable energy loss. Moreover, it has been shown that a two-stage charging process, i.e. first galvanostatic charging followed by a potentiostatic charge redistribution, resulted in considerably slower potential changes when the device was switched to the open circuit. All discussed models were based on the assumption that the energy accumulated by EDLCs is proportional to the voltage in the second power, with capacitance (C/2) as the proportionality constant. However, it has been shown that during EDLC charging or discharging through a resistance R, equations valid for `dielectric' and electrolytic capacitors, do not hold in the case of EDLCs. Consequently, the assumption that the energetic state of the EDLC is proportional at any time to the voltage in the second power may not be valid due to considerable variability of the `constant' C. Therefore, voltage changes may not reflect the energetic state of the device.},

The discovery of the system dates back to earlier work by Asahi Kasei in Japan, which used a combination of lower temperature carbons for the negative electrode to prevent solvent degradation and lithium cobalt dioxide modified somewhat from Goodenough's earlier work. The development by Sony was carried out within a few years by bringing together technology in film coating from their magnetic tape division and electrochemical technology from their battery division. The past 25 years has shown rapid growth in the sales and in the benefits of lithium ion in comparison to all the earlier rechargeable battery systems. Recent work on new materials shows that there is a good likelihood that the lithium ion battery will continue to improve in cost, energy, safety and power capability and will be a formidable competitor for some years to come.},

  abstract = {Carbon materials, owing to their excellent electrical conductivity, tailorability, inexpensiveness and versatility, have been extensively studied as electrode materials for supercapacitors. The capacitance of carbon-based supercapacitor electrodes has remained at a mediocre level between 100 and 200 F g-1 for decades. Until recently, a new family of carbon materials termed hierarchical porous carbons has pushed the capacitance to new benchmark values beyond 300 F g-1, and has revitalized the exploration of carbon materials for supercapacitors. Hierarchical porous carbons contain different scales of pores (from micropores to macropores) inter-connected together and assembled in hierarchical patterns. Experimental studies coupled with theoretical investigations have elucidated that the presence of micropores is responsible for offering a large surface area to enhance charge storage capability, whilst mesopores, macropores and the hierarchical structure improve electrolyte infiltration and facilitate ion diffusion. This review will start by introducing different pore types and the definition of hierarchical porous structures, followed by discussion and exemplification of major synthesis strategies. In addition, recent molecular-level understanding of the relationship between pore size, functionalities inside pores, pore spatial distribution and capacitive performance is presented. Finally, challenges and future opportunities associated with hierarchical porous carbons for supercapacitors are discussed.},

Rechargeable aluminium-based batteries offer the possibilities of low cost and low flammability, together with three-electron-redox properties leading to high capacity3. However, research efforts over the past 30 years have encountered numerous problems, such as cathode material disintegration4, low cell discharge voltage (about 0.55 volts; ref. 5), capacitive behaviour without discharge voltage plateaus (1.1\textendash{}0.2 volts6 or 1.8\textendash{}0.8 volts7) and insufficient cycle life (less than 100 cycles) with rapid capacity decay (by 26\textendash{}85 per cent over 100 cycles)4,5,6,7. Here we present a rechargeable aluminium battery with high-rate capability that uses an aluminium metal anode and a three-dimensional graphitic-foam cathode. The battery operates through the electrochemical deposition and dissolution of aluminium at the anode, and intercalation/de-intercalation of chloroaluminate anions in the graphite, using a non-flammable ionic liquid electrolyte. The cell exhibits well-defined discharge voltage plateaus near 2 volts, a specific capacity of about 70 mA h g\textendash{}1 and a Coulombic efficiency of approximately 98 per cent. The cathode was found to enable fast anion diffusion and intercalation, affording charging times of around one minute with a current density of \textasciitilde{}4,000 mA g\textendash{}1 (equivalent to \textasciitilde{}3,000 W kg\textendash{}1), and to withstand more than 7,500 cycles without capacity decay.},

However, the low cost-effectiveness and performance limit its practical application, thus requiring low-cost cathode-electrolyte system with large-scale manufacturing potential. In this work, we successfully achieved a low-cost and high-performance AIB system consisting of commercial expanded graphite (EG) cathode and AlCl3-triethylamine hydrochloride (AlCl3-ET) electrolyte. The assembled AIB exhibited the cathode capacity of 78.3 {$\pm$} 4.1 mAh g-1 (156.6 {$\pm$} 8.2 mAh cm-3) at 5 A g-1 with 77.5\% retention after 30 000 cycles.

We confirmed the part of the cathode capacity was contributed by AlCl4- deposition, and the reaction mechanism of our new system resulted from the special structure of EG, which served as an important supplement of the classical mechanism of AIB. The high capacity of EG-AIB was contributed by AlCl4- deposition and its stage 4 intercalation.

Recently, an ultrafast rechargeable aluminum-ion battery was experimentally demonstrated through the reversible intercalation/deintercalation of chloroaluminate anions (AlCl4\textendash{}) in graphitic-foam cathodes. Using first-principles calculations, herein, we report that the unique structural characteristic of graphitic foam, i.e., mechanical flexibility of few-layered graphene nanomaterials, plays a key role for the ultrafast aluminum-ion battery. We found that AlCl4\textendash{} is stored by forming doubly stacked ionic layers in the interlayer space between graphene sheets, and their diffusivity increases dramatically once graphene film is less than five layers thick; the diffusivity begins to increase when the film thickness reduces below five layers in such a way that the film thickness of four, three, and two graphene layers enables 48, 153, and 225 times enhanced diffusivity than that of the bulk graphite, respectively, and this nanoscale thickness is mainly responsible for the observed ultrafast rate capability of graphitic foam. The faster anion conductivity with the reduced film thickness is attributed to high elasticity of few-layered graphene, providing more space for facile AlCl4\textendash{} diffusion. This study indicates that even bulky polyanions can be adopted as carrier ions for ultrahigh rate operation if highly elastic few-layered graphene is used as an active material.},

This raises an interesting problem concerning how the AlCl4 clusters can diffuse so fast in the graphite cathode. In this paper, we first demonstrate by means of density functional theory calculations that AlCl4 cluster exists in graphite with planar quadrangle geometry, rather than a tetrahedral structure. Upon AlCl4 intercalation, the interlayer spacing distance between graphene layers is substantially enlarged from 3.353{\AA} to 6.025{\AA}. With such a large spacing, the AlCl4 diffusion becomes very easy with migration energy barriers ranging from 0.023 to 0.089eV for different migration paths in a 2-dimensional diffusion plane. These results give underlying explanation to the dynamic performance of the graphite-based Al-ion batteries.},

During discharge, a nanometer-thin ({$<$} 5 nm) layer of Li2O2 forms homogeneously throughout the electrode before it is passivated at a final specific charge of {$\sim$}365 mAh/g. Higher discharge charge rates lead to thinner and more densely packed layers of Li2O2. Electrolyte decomposition also occurs in parallel, as evidenced by the continuous increase of LiF and sulfur containing species of the degraded LiTFSI salt. On charge, O2 evolves initially according to a 2e-/O2 rate, but as the cell over-potentials increase, O2 evolution rate approaches 4e-/O2, thus demonstrating a significant extent of parasitic side-reactions. Unlike the discharge, the charge leads to inhomogeneous electrode reactions causing a continuous removal of Li2O2 with no indication of LiO2 or Li2O intermediates. The decomposition side-products formed during discharge are also removed and the spectra of the pristine electrode are nearly retained at a full charge. Our results show that the analysis of Li-O2 battery chemistry requires broad approach based on the combination of various electrode surface sensitive techniques, such as XPS and OEMS, in order to provide further fundamental understanding of the mechanisms behind the complex electrochemistry involving the Li and O2 as well as several other predominant degradation products of the electrode and electrolyte.},

  abstract = {Supercapacitors have been widely studied around the world in recent years, due to their excellent power density and long cycle life. As the most frequently used electrode materials for supercapacitors, carbonaceous materials attract more and more attention. However, their relatively low energy density still holds back the widespread application. Up to now, various strategies have been developed to figure out this problem. This research news summarizes the recent advances in improving the supercapacitor performance of carbonaceous materials, including the incorporation of heteroatoms and the pore size effect (subnanopores' contribution). In addition, a new class of carbonaceous materials, porous organic networks (PONs) has been managed into the supercapacitor field, which promises great potential in not only improving the supercapacitor performances, but also unraveling the related mechanisms.},

The hydrophilic nature of hemp shiv, a plant based aggregate, results in composites having poor interfacial adhesion, weak mechanical properties and long drying times. In this work, sol-gel process has been utilised to manufacture durable low density hemp based composites. Morphological characterisation by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that hemp shiv was embedded well in the matrix. Detailed chemical analysis using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) indicate the presence of water soluble and ethanol soluble extractives leached from the hemp shiv which are incorporated into the silica matrix inducing the binding effect. The composites were water resistant and showed good mechanical performance having the potential to develop novel thermal insulation building materials.},

This is supported with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements and associated core-level shift DFT calculations. We compare the oxygen 1s spectra from oxygen impurities in C60 and C59N, and calculate a range of possible oxidized and hydroxylated structures and associated formation barriers. These results allow us to propose a model for the oxygen present in these samples, notably the importance of water surface adsorption and possible ice formation.

  abstract = {Carbon black (CB) additives commonly used to increase the electrical conductivity of electrodes in Li-ion batteries are generally believed to be electrochemically inert additives in cathodes. Decomposition of electrolyte in the surface region of CB in Li-ion cells at high voltages up to 4.9 V is here studied using electrochemical measurements as well as structural and surface characterizations. LiPF6 and LiClO4 dissolved in ethylene carbonate:diethylene carbonate (1:1) were used as the electrolyte to study irreversible charge capacity of CB cathodes when cycled between 4.9 V and 2.5 V. Synchrotron-based soft X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (SOXPES) results revealed spontaneous partial decomposition of the electrolytes on the CB electrode, without applying external current or voltage. Depth profile analysis of the electrolyte/cathode interphase indicated that the concentration of decomposed species is highest at the outermost surface of the CB. It is concluded that carboxylate and carbonate bonds (originating from solvent decomposition) and LiF (when LiPF6 was used) take part in the formation of the decomposed species. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements and transmission electron microscopy results, however, did not show formation of a dense surface layer on CB particles.},

  abstract = {Novel and high-performance anode materials based on modified fullerene materials, for lithium-ion rechargeable batteries were developed. The technical feasibility of lithium-ion intercalation and de-intercalation based on the degree of anion or atomic modification of the fullerene was examined. In this approach the fullerene molecule is viewed as a large anchor molecule to which various anion or atoms can be attached to form C 60 A x , where A could be hydrogen. The lithium-ion intercalation and de-intercalation could be driven by the formation of C 60 AxLix. This could result in anode materials with a potential capacity of {$>$}1200 mAh/g. Fullerenes (mixed C 60 /C 70 , pure C 60 , and pure C 70 ) and hydrogenated fullerenes, both as thin film and as pasted powdered electrode in solid polymer and liquid electrolyte, were investigated. The results of this investigation demonstrated that (1) capacities of a thin film fullerene electrode in a solid polymer electrolyte were found to be low, corresponding to three lithium ions per fullerene molecule, (2) thin film hydrogenated fullerene electrodes resulted in a significant increase in capacity, and lithium-ion intercalation was found to correspond exactly to the degree of hydrogenation of fullerenes, and (3) only certain hydrogenated fullerenes were, surprisingly, found to be effective as high-performance anode materials in liquid electrolyte. Capacities as high as 1100 mAh/g of hydrogenated fullerenes were achieved. This capacity was again found to correspond to the degree of fullerenes hydrogenation of this specific fullerene. In addition, it was found that hydrogenated fullerenes can be added in small quantities to commercial carbon to significantly reduce the irreversible capacity and improve their reversible capacity.},

  abstract = {The electrochemically active polymers have been formed during electro-reduction carried out in solution containing fullerenes, C60 or C70, and transition metal complexes of Pd(II), Pt(II), Rh(III), and Ir(I). In these films, fullerene moieties are covalently bounded to transition metal atoms (Pd and Pt) or their complexes (Rh and Ir) to form a polymeric network. All films exhibit electrochemical activity at negative potentials due to the fullerene cages reduction process. For all studied metal complexes, yields of formation of films containing C70 are higher than yields of electrodeposition of their C60 analogs. C70 /M films also exhibit higher porosity in comparison to C60/M layers. The differences in film morphology and efficiency of polymer formation are responsible for differences in electrochemical responses of these films in acetonitrile containing supporting electrolyte only. C70/M films shows more reversible voltammeric behavior in negative potential range. They also show higher potential range of electrochemical stability. Processes of film formation and electrochemical properties of polymers depend on the transition metal ions or atoms bonding fullerene cages into polymeric network. The highest efficiency of polymerization was observed for fullerene/Pd and fullerene/Rh films. In the case of fullerene/Pd films, the charge transfer processes related to the fullerene moieties reduction in negative potential range exhibit the best reversibility among all of the studied systems. Capacitance performances of C60/Pd and C70/Pd films deposited on the porous Au/quartz electrode were also compared. Capacitance properties of both films are significantly affected by the conditions of electropolymerization. Only a fraction of the film having a direct contact with solution contributes to pseudocapacitance. Capacitance properties of these films also depend on the size of cations of supporting electrolyte. The C70/Pd film exhibits much better capacitance performance comparison to C60/Pd polymer.},

At this relatively high sulfur loading, we evaluated the impact of binder and carbon type on the mechanical integrity and the electrochemical properties of sulfur electrodes. We identified hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) as a new binder for the sulfur electrode because it offers better adhesion between the electrode and the aluminum current collector than the commonly used polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) binder. In combination with the binder study, multiple types of carbon with high specific surface area were evaluated as sulfur hosts for high loading sulfur electrodes. A commercial microporous carbon derived from wood with high pore volume showed the best performance. An electrode with sulfur loading up to 10 mg cm-2 was achieved with the optimized recipe. Based on systematic electrochemical studies, the soluble polysulfide to insoluble Li2S2/Li2S conversion was identified to be the major barrier for high loading sulfur electrodes to achieve high sulfur utilization.},

  abstract = {Recently, Li-S batteries with a high theoretical specific energy have attracted significant attention. However, their practical application is still seriously hindered by the shuttling effect of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) in the Li-S batteries system. Introducing anchoring materials into the cathode or separator, which can strongly attract LiPSs because of advisable binding energies, has been demonstrated as an effective strategy to alleviate the shuttling effect for achieving the excellent cycling performance of Li-S batteries. In this work, the complete mechanistic understanding of the interaction between non-metallic monolayer materials (N-MMLMs, including Graphene, BN, C2N and C3N4) and LiPSs is given in detail with the aid of density functional theory. The calculation results show that N-MMLM can combine the chemical interaction and the physical entrapment of sulfur species to suppress the shuttling effect. C3N4 and C2N are predicted to trap LiPSs via stronger interfacial interaction and alleviate the interactions between LiPSs and solvents as well as the consequent dissolution. The strong anchoring effect of C3N4/C2N comes from the bonding of Li-N/C-S and charge transfer. Further charge transfer study reveals that the C3N4/C2N can serve as an electrocatalyst, which effectively accelerates the kinetics of LiPSs redox reactions.},

Mitigation of PS dissolution in electrolyte involves the search for a new electrolyte solvent system that exhibits poor solvation to the PS while still having good solvation ability to the electrolyte salt for high ionic conductivity. Applying cosolvents with reduced solvating power but compatible with the state of the art Li\textendash{}S battery's ether-based electrolyte is one of the most promising concepts. This route is also advantageous of having a low scale-up cost. With the aid of quantum chemical calculation, we have identified high carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratio ethers as cosolvent in the new electrolytes that effectively impede PS dissolution while still maintaining high ionic conductivity. Significantly improved cycle life and cycling Coulombic efficiency are observed for Li\textendash{}S cells using the new composite electrolytes. Anode analysis with different methods also demonstrate that reducing electrolyte's PS solubility results in less sulfur total amount on the lithium anode surface and lower ratio of the longer-chain PS, which is probably a sign of suppressed side reactions between the anode and PS in the electrolyte.},

  abstract = {Lithium-sulfur battery is a new energy storage device with low cost, high energy storage density and environmental protection. It is an important tool for future battery systems. However, due to the shuttle of polysulfides, the insulation performance of sulfur and the volume change, the capacity decay and cycle instability result, which limits the future application of lithium sulfur batteries. Two-dimensional materials such as graphene, carbide, nitride, sulfide, oxide and their aggregates provide high surface area to improve sulfur utilization and cycle performance. In this manuscript, we review various two-dimensional materials through physical confinement and chemical interactions to inhibit the shuttle of polysulfides. We outline the controlled spacing of two-dimensional materials, abundant active sites and large transverse size separators and interlayers. The effects of interlayer and separator based on two-dimensional materials on lithium anode prevent polysulfide dissolution, were reviewed. Finally, the challenges and prospects of two-dimensional materials for lithium-sulfur batteries are prospected.},

The preparation process was systematically investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Raman spectroscopy and Brunauer\textendash{}Emmett\textendash{}Teller (BET) measurements. The morphology and structure of graphene sheets were characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). The electrochemical performances were evaluated in coin-type cells versus metallic lithium. It is found that the graphene sheets possess a curled morphology consisting of a thin wrinkled paper-like structure, fewer layers ({$\sim$}4 layers) and large specific surface area (492.5m2g-1). The first reversible specific capacity of the prepared graphene sheets was as high as 1264mAhg-1 at a current density of 100mAg-1. Even at a high current density of 500mAg-1, the reversible specific capacity remained at 718mAhg-1. After 40 cycles, the reversible capacity was still kept at 848mAhg-1 at the current density of 100mAg-1. These results indicate that the prepared high quality graphene sheets possess excellent electrochemical performances for lithium storage.},

Graphite is a practical anode material used for LIB, because of its capability for reversible lithium ion intercalation in the layered crystals, and the structural similarities of GNS to graphite may provide another type of intercalation anode compound. While the accommodation of lithium in these layered compounds is influenced by the layer spacing between the graphene nanosheets, control of the intergraphene sheet distance through interacting molecules such as carbon nanotubes (CNT) or fullerenes (C60) might be crucial for enhancement of the storage capacity. The specific capacity of GNS was found to be 540 mAh/g, which is much larger than that of graphite, and this was increased up to 730 mAh/g and 784 mAh/g, respectively, by the incorporation of macromolecules of CNT and C60 to the GNS.},

This is due to their relatively short mass and charge pathways, high transport rates of both lithium ions and electrons, and other extremely charming surface activities. In this review paper, the effect of the nanostructure on the electrochemical performance of these anodes is presented. Their synthesis processes, electrochemical properties, and electrode reaction mechanisms are also discussed. The major goals of this review are to give a broad overview of recent scientific researches and developments of anode materials using novel nanoscience and nanotechnology and to highlight new progresses in using these nanostructured materials to develop high-performance LIBs.

In recent years, the performance of aluminium-ion batteries has improved remarkably in all battery-relevant metrics, which renders them a promising alternative. Compared with monovalent Li-ion batteries, aluminium (Al) cations can carry three positive charges, which could result in higher energy densities. This review describes recent developments in Al-based cathode materials. The major goal of this review is to highlight strengths and weaknesses of various different approaches and provide guidelines for future research.},

  abstract = {Understanding the factors limiting Li+ charge transfer kinetics in Li-ion batteries is essential in improving the rate performance, especially at lower temperatures. The Li+ charge transfer process involved in the lithium intercalation of graphite anode includes the step of de-solvation of the solvated Li+ in the liquid electrolyte and the step of transport of Li+ in the preformed solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on electrodes until the Li+ accepts an electron at the electrode and becomes a Li in the electrode. Whether the de-solvation process or the Li+ transport through the SEI is a limiting step depends on the nature of the interphases at the electrode and electrolyte interfaces. Several examples involving the electrode materials such as graphite, lithium titanate (LTO), lithium iron phosphate (LFP), lithium nickel cobalt aluminum oxide (NCA) and solid Li+ conductor such as lithium lanthanum titanate or Li-Al-Ti-phosphate are reviewed and discussed to clarify the conditions at which either the de-solvation or the transport of Li+ in SEI is dominating and how the electrolyte components affect the activation energy of Li+ charge transfer kinetics. How the electrolyte additives impact the Li+ charge transfer kinetics at both the anode and the cathode has been examined at the same time in 3-electrode full cells. The resulting impact on Li+ charge transfer resistance, Rct, and activation energy, Ea, at both electrodes are reported and discussed.},

  abstract = {Graphite-based dual-ion batteries (DIBs) which involve the intercalation of anions into the carbon layers are promising for high power applications. Many researchers inevitably choose ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC) as the electrolyte as they observe superior electrochemical performances compared to other solvents. Here, we clarify the underlying reason why EMC is better. Specifically, EMC forms a thinner layer of cathode electrolyte interface on the graphite surface with fewer Li-F and ROCO2Li species than that with dimethyl carbonate and diethyl carbonate. EMC electrolyte reduces charge-transfer resistance, polarization and self-discharge of graphite electrodes. It also enhances Coulombic efficiency, cycle and rate performances, allowing 90\% of the capacity to be available from graphite even at 12 C (1200 mA g-1). Our work also emphasizes the importance of electrolyte and electrolyte-interface on future developments of DIBs.},

  abstract = {Due to the unprecedented development and popularization of portable electronics, electric vehicles and smart grid, rechargeable batteries have becoming one of the hottest topics within worldwide researchers for the last decade. Among all the proposed non-lithium-based battery systems, rechargeable aluminum-ion batteries (RAIBs) are considered as a promising candidate due to aluminum's abundance and safety. Naturally, exploring compatible and high-performance cathode materials for RAIBs becomes a key issue for pushing RAIBs from lab-level to industrialization. In this work, we report a novel high-performance RAIB system using MOF-derived Co3O4@MWCNTs polyhedron composite as cathode. The well-defined morphology of MOF-derived Co3O4 and enhancement brought by MWCNTs allow Co3O4@MWCNTs polyhedrons to deliver an initial discharge capacity of ca. 266.3 mAh g-1, and the reversible specific capacity can reach to 125 mAh g-1 at 100 mA g-1 over 150 cycles. The energy storage mechanism has been verified to be a reversible valence-change reaction between Co3O4 and Co. These findings can enlighten future researches regrading to MOF derivatives as advanced cathode materials for RAIBs.},

  abstract = {Phenolic resin is a thermosetting polymer resin is that is known for its excellent thermal properties and chemical stability. Thus, it could be advantageous if it could be utilized in graphite polymer composites as the cathode in aluminium ion batteries. In this study, graphite polymer composites with 3 cm of diameter and 3 cm of thickness had been fabricated and then their thermal characteristics were determined. The composition ratios of 40/60, 50/50, 60/40 and 70/30 by their weight percentage (wt\%) of graphite/phenol respectively were fabricated using the hot compression method. Any further increment of graphite percentage in the composition would produce a very fragile composite. In the physical properties characterization, the bulk density, true density, and porosity percentage were determined. Besides, the thermal conductivity of the graphite composites had been measured according to ASTM E1350 standard for thermal characterization. It is observed that an increase in graphite content results in an increase in porosity content and thus reducing its thermal conductivity. It is concluded that a composition of 40/60 and 50/50 by its \%wt of graphite/phenol has good physical and thermal properties with \textasciitilde{}1.7 g/cm3, 6\textendash{}8\%, and \textasciitilde{}36 W/mK of bulk density, porosity percentage and thermal conductivity, respectively.},

  abstract = {Graphene is of great significance in energy storage devices. However, a graphene-based electrode is difficult to use in direct applications due to the large surface area and flexibility, which leads to the excessive consumption of electrolyte, low Coulombic efficiency, and electrode shedding behaviors. Herein, a special crystal carbon@graphene microsphere (CCGM) composite was successfully synthesized. The scalable carbonaceous microsphere composite displays a small specific surface area and a superior structure stability. As a potassium ion battery electrode in a half-cell, CCGM delivers an initial capacity of 297.89 mAh g\textendash{}1 with a high Coulombic efficiency of about 99\%. It achieves an excellent cyclic stability with no capacity loss after 1250 cycles at the low current density of 100 mA g\textendash{}1 with a long performing period of more than one year. As the cathode for an aluminum battery, a reversible specific capacity of 99.1 mAh g\textendash{}1 at 1000 mA g\textendash{}1 is obtained. CCGM delivers a long cycle performance of about 10 000 cycles at 4000 mA g\textendash{}1 with a capacity retention of nearly 100\%. Our design provides a fresh thought for the improvement of graphene-based materials, and it will greatly facilitate the application of graphene in the field of energy storage.},
