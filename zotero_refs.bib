  abstract = {The thermodynamic properties of magnesium make it a natural choice for use as an anode material in rechargeable batteries, because it may provide a considerably higher energy density than the commonly used lead\textendash{}acid and nickel\textendash{}cadmium systems. Moreover, in contrast to lead and cadmium, magnesium is inexpensive, environmentally friendly and safe to handle. But the development of Mg batteries has been hindered by two problems. First, owing to the chemical activity of Mg, only solutions that neither donate nor accept protons are suitable as electrolytes; but most of these solutions allow the growth of passivating surface films, which inhibit any electrochemical reaction. Second, the choice of cathode materials has been limited by the difficulty of intercalating Mg ions in many hosts. Following previous studies of the electrochemistry of Mg electrodes in various non-aqueous solutions, and of a variety of intercalation electrodes, we have now developed rechargeable Mg battery systems that show promise for applications. The systems comprise electrolyte solutions based on Mg organohaloaluminate salts, and MgxMo 3S4 cathodes, into which Mg ions can be intercalated reversibly, and with relatively fast kinetics. We expect that further improvements in the energy density will make these batteries a viable alternative to existing systems.},

Much research has focused on the judicious selection of graphite cathode materials, leading to the most notable recent advances in the performance of AlCl3-GBs. However, the major obstacle to commercializing this technology is the lack of oxidatively stable, inexpensive current collectors that can operate in chloroaluminate ionic liquids and are composed of earth-abundant elements. This study presents the use of titanium nitride (TiN) as a compelling material for this purpose. Flexible current collectors can be fabricated by coating TiN on stainless steel or flexible polyimide substrates by low-cost, rapid, scalable methods such as magnetron sputtering. When these current collectors are used in AlCl3-GB coin or pouch cells, stable cathodic operation is observed at voltages of up to 2.5 V versus Al3+/Al. Furthermore, these batteries have a high coulombic efficiency of 99.5\%, power density of 4500 W kg-1, and cyclability of at least 500 cycles.},

Among them, Al-ion batteries based on aluminum anode and graphite carbon cathode have gained lots of interests as one of the most promising technologies. Here, it is demonstrated that the size of graphitic material in ab plane and c direction plays an important role in anion intercalation chemistry. Sharply decreasing the size of vertical dimension (c direction) strongly facilitates the kinetics and charge transfer of anions (de)intercalation. On the other hand, increasing the size of horizontal dimension (ab plane) contributes to improving the flexibility of graphitic materials, which results in raising the cycling stability. Meanwhile, chloroaluminate anions are reversibly intercalated into the interlayer of graphite materials, leading to the staging behaviors. In the end, an ultrafast Al-ion battery with exceptional long life is achieved based on large-sized few-layer graphene as a cathode and aluminum metal as an anode.},

When detrimental surface-related effects such as irreversible capacity loss due to interphase formation (known as solid-electrolyte interphase, SEI) can be mitigated or altogether avoided, the greatest advantage can be achieved by maximizing the gravimetric and volumetric surface area and by tailoring the porosity to accommodate the relevant ion species.

Ab initio molecular dynamics is performed to investigate the thermal stability of AlCl4 intercalated graphite structures. Our voltage profiles show that the first AlCl4 intercalation step could be a more sluggish step than the successive intercalation steps. However, the diffusion of AlCl4 is very fast in the expanded graphite host layers with a diffusion barrier of {$\sim$}0.01 eV, which justifies the ultrafast charging rate of a graphite based Al-ion battery. And such an AlCl4 intercalated battery provides an average voltage of 2.01\textendash{}2.3 V with a maximum specific capacity of 69.62 mA h g-1, which is excellent for anion intercalated batteries. Our density of states and Bader charge analysis shows that the AlCl4 intercalation into the bulk graphite is a charging process. Hence, we believe that our present study will be helpful in understanding the staging mechanism of AlCl4 intercalation into graphite-like layered electrodes for Al-ion batteries, thus encouraging further experimental work.},

  abstract = {Using first-principles calculations and molecular dynamics simulation, we study the working mechanism in an aluminum-graphite electrochemical cell, which was recently reported to exhibit attractive performance. We exclude the possibility of Al3+ cation intercalation into graphite as in standard Li-ion batteries. Instead, we show that the AlCl4- anion intercalation mechanism is thermodynamically feasible. By including the ionic liquid electrolyte in the overall redox reaction, we are able to reproduce the high voltage observed in experiment. The active involvement of electrolyte in the reaction suggests that the evaluation of energy density needs to take the electrolyte into consideration. Our proposed structural model is consistent with the new peaks appearing in X-ray diffraction from the intercalation compound. The high rate capability is explained by the ultralow diffusion barriers of the AlCl4 intercalant. With the clarified working mechanism, it becomes clear that the high voltage of the Al-graphite cell is a result of the thermodynamic instability of the AlCl4-intercalated graphite. \textcopyright{} 2017 American Chemical Society.},

Carbon nanotubes with hollow structures and large surface area are able to overcome the difficulty of activating the opening of interlayer spaces as observed in graphite electrode during the first intercalation cycle. Our results show that AlCl4 binds strongly with the SWNT to result in an energetically and thermally stable AlCl4-adsorbed SWNT system. Diffusion calculations show that the SWNT system allows ultrafast diffusion of AlCl4 with a more favorable inner surface diffusion than outer surface diffusion. Our charge-density difference and Bader atomic charge analysis confirm the oxidation of SWNT upon adsorption of AlCl4, which shows a similar behavior to the previously studied graphite cathode. The average open-circuit voltage and AlCl4 storage capacity increases with increasing SWNT diameter and can be as high as 1.96\hspace{0.25em}V and 275\hspace{0.25em}mA\,h\,g-1 in (25,25) SWNT relative to graphite (70\hspace{0.25em}mA\,h\,g-1).

Because of this, onion-like carbon can be fabricated into electrodes, used as a conductive additive, and may have potential in composites and additive manufacturing. However due to agglomeration of OLC particles, creating a stable, aqueous dispersion for ink production or formulating composites proves challenging. We explore how attrition milling, acid treatment, and probe sonication can be employed to decrease agglomeration and provide colloidal stability in aqueous media. We also investigate how the electrochemical performance changes with each processing step as well as the treatments in succession. When tested in electrochemical capacitors, the processing increases the capacitance by a factor of three, due to an added pseudocapacitive contribution which is not present in untreated OLC. As a result, the processing of OLC proves to be advantageous for the production of stable, aqueous solutions, which also exhibit improved electrochemical properties suitable for functional inks, conductive additives, and fabrication of composite electrodes.},

In this paper, we first demonstrate by means of density functional theory calculations that AlCl4 cluster exists in graphite with planar quadrangle geometry, rather than a tetrahedral structure. Upon AlCl4 intercalation, the interlayer spacing distance between graphene layers is substantially enlarged from 3.353{\AA} to 6.025{\AA}. With such a large spacing, the AlCl4 diffusion becomes very easy with migration energy barriers ranging from 0.023 to 0.089eV for different migration paths in a 2-dimensional diffusion plane. These results give underlying explanation to the dynamic performance of the graphite-based Al-ion batteries.},

Recently, an ultrafast rechargeable aluminum-ion battery was experimentally demonstrated through the reversible intercalation/deintercalation of chloroaluminate anions (AlCl4\textendash{}) in graphitic-foam cathodes. Using first-principles calculations, herein, we report that the unique structural characteristic of graphitic foam, i.e., mechanical flexibility of few-layered graphene nanomaterials, plays a key role for the ultrafast aluminum-ion battery. We found that AlCl4\textendash{} is stored by forming doubly stacked ionic layers in the interlayer space between graphene sheets, and their diffusivity increases dramatically once graphene film is less than five layers thick; the diffusivity begins to increase when the film thickness reduces below five layers in such a way that the film thickness of four, three, and two graphene layers enables 48, 153, and 225 times enhanced diffusivity than that of the bulk graphite, respectively, and this nanoscale thickness is mainly responsible for the observed ultrafast rate capability of graphitic foam. The faster anion conductivity with the reduced film thickness is attributed to high elasticity of few-layered graphene, providing more space for facile AlCl4\textendash{} diffusion. This study indicates that even bulky polyanions can be adopted as carrier ions for ultrahigh rate operation if highly elastic few-layered graphene is used as an active material.},

The capacitance of carbon-based supercapacitor electrodes has remained at a mediocre level between 100 and 200 F g-1 for decades. Until recently, a new family of carbon materials termed hierarchical porous carbons has pushed the capacitance to new benchmark values beyond 300 F g-1, and has revitalized the exploration of carbon materials for supercapacitors. Hierarchical porous carbons contain different scales of pores (from micropores to macropores) inter-connected together and assembled in hierarchical patterns. Experimental studies coupled with theoretical investigations have elucidated that the presence of micropores is responsible for offering a large surface area to enhance charge storage capability, whilst mesopores, macropores and the hierarchical structure improve electrolyte infiltration and facilitate ion diffusion. This review will start by introducing different pore types and the definition of hierarchical porous structures, followed by discussion and exemplification of major synthesis strategies. In addition, recent molecular-level understanding of the relationship between pore size, functionalities inside pores, pore spatial distribution and capacitive performance is presented. Finally, challenges and future opportunities associated with hierarchical porous carbons for supercapacitors are discussed.},

  abstract = {Carbon black (CB) additives commonly used to increase the electrical conductivity of electrodes in Li-ion batteries are generally believed to be electrochemically inert additives in cathodes. Decomposition of electrolyte in the surface region of CB in Li-ion cells at high voltages up to 4.9 V is here studied using electrochemical measurements as well as structural and surface characterizations. LiPF6 and LiClO4 dissolved in ethylene carbonate:diethylene carbonate (1:1) were used as the electrolyte to study irreversible charge capacity of CB cathodes when cycled between 4.9 V and 2.5 V. Synchrotron-based soft X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (SOXPES) results revealed spontaneous partial decomposition of the electrolytes on the CB electrode, without applying external current or voltage. Depth profile analysis of the electrolyte/cathode interphase indicated that the concentration of decomposed species is highest at the outermost surface of the CB. It is concluded that carboxylate and carbonate bonds (originating from solvent decomposition) and LiF (when LiPF6 was used) take part in the formation of the decomposed species. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements and transmission electron microscopy results, however, did not show formation of a dense surface layer on CB particles.},

  abstract = {C60 fullerene crystals may serve as important catalysts for interstellar organic chemistry. To explore this possibility, the electronic structures of free-standing powders of C60 and (C59N)2 azafullerenes are characterized using X-ray microscopy with near-edge X-ray adsorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy, closely coupled with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This is supported with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements and associated core-level shift DFT calculations. We compare the oxygen 1s spectra from oxygen impurities in C60 and C59N, and calculate a range of possible oxidized and hydroxylated structures and associated formation barriers. These results allow us to propose a model for the oxygen present in these samples, notably the importance of water surface adsorption and possible ice formation. Water adsorption on C60 crystal surfaces may prove important for astrobiological studies of interstellar amino acid formation.},

  abstract = {This study focuses on the development of novel bio-composites using a silica matrix that provides dual functionality: as a hydrophobic surface treatment and as a binder for hemp-shiv. The hydrophilic nature of hemp shiv, a plant based aggregate, results in composites having poor interfacial adhesion, weak mechanical properties and long drying times. In this work, sol-gel process has been utilised to manufacture durable low density hemp based composites. Morphological characterisation by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that hemp shiv was embedded well in the matrix. Detailed chemical analysis using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) indicate the presence of water soluble and ethanol soluble extractives leached from the hemp shiv which are incorporated into the silica matrix inducing the binding effect. The composites were water resistant and showed good mechanical performance having the potential to develop novel thermal insulation building materials.},

  abstract = {Supercapacitors have been widely studied around the world in recent years, due to their excellent power density and long cycle life. As the most frequently used electrode materials for supercapacitors, carbonaceous materials attract more and more attention. However, their relatively low energy density still holds back the widespread application. Up to now, various strategies have been developed to figure out this problem. This research news summarizes the recent advances in improving the supercapacitor performance of carbonaceous materials, including the incorporation of heteroatoms and the pore size effect (subnanopores' contribution). In addition, a new class of carbonaceous materials, porous organic networks (PONs) has been managed into the supercapacitor field, which promises great potential in not only improving the supercapacitor performances, but also unraveling the related mechanisms.},

  abstract = {The surface chemistry of the commonly employed positive electrode substrate Super C65 carbon was investigated during the 1st cycle of a Li-O2 battery with a typical ether electrolyte (0.2 M LiTFSI in Diglyme) by performing in situ online electrochemical mass spectrometry (OEMS), ex situ scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). During discharge, a nanometer-thin ({$<$} 5 nm) layer of Li2O2 forms homogeneously throughout the electrode before it is passivated at a final specific charge of {$\sim$}365 mAh/g. Higher discharge charge rates lead to thinner and more densely packed layers of Li2O2. Electrolyte decomposition also occurs in parallel, as evidenced by the continuous increase of LiF and sulfur containing species of the degraded LiTFSI salt. On charge, O2 evolves initially according to a 2e-/O2 rate, but as the cell over-potentials increase, O2 evolution rate approaches 4e-/O2, thus demonstrating a significant extent of parasitic side-reactions. Unlike the discharge, the charge leads to inhomogeneous electrode reactions causing a continuous removal of Li2O2 with no indication of LiO2 or Li2O intermediates. The decomposition side-products formed during discharge are also removed and the spectra of the pristine electrode are nearly retained at a full charge. Our results show that the analysis of Li-O2 battery chemistry requires broad approach based on the combination of various electrode surface sensitive techniques, such as XPS and OEMS, in order to provide further fundamental understanding of the mechanisms behind the complex electrochemistry involving the Li and O2 as well as several other predominant degradation products of the electrode and electrolyte.},

The composites were received by immerison of nanotubes into fullerene solution in CS2 with consequent processing with green laser irradiation at aproximately 10 W/cm2. It was shown that C1s spectra of composites are different from simple addition of MWNT and C60 features. It found that preliminary nanotube purification by oxidative treatment influences strongly the nature of fullerene-nanotube bonding. Hydrophilic surface of oxidized nanotube material has lower affinity to C60 molecules and provides for concentration of C60 molecules into clusters, which show differential charging effect in XPS spectra. The differential charging effect disappears after laser processing, which induces photopolymerization of fullerene clusters. The as-synthesized nanotubes form composites with more evenly distributed fullerene.},
